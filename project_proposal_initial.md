Keywords: Price Trends, Domestic Consumption Trends, Trade Data Analysis

Description: This project aims to conduct a Value vs. Volume Analysis and Demand Trend Analysis on U.S. agricultural imports using data from the USDA Economic Research Service. The dataset contains detailed information on agricultural imports, including values and volumes for various product categories. Key questions to be addressed include:

- How have per-unit prices of imported agricultural products changed over time?
- Which products show significant price fluctuations or stability?
- What trends in import volumes suggest changes in domestic consumption patterns?

Intellectual Merit: The knowledge obtained from this project can be used for providing new insights into the dynamics of agricultural import pricing. It can uncover new trends in U.S. consumer preferences for agricultural products by analyzing long-term import patterns. There is a possibility of creating a new approach for estimating domestic demand from import data, adding to the techniques used in trade analysis and agricultural economics.

Data Sourcing: The primary data source is the USDA Economic Research Service dataset on U.S. agricultural imports. The data can be directly retrieved from the following website - "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/foreign-agricultural-trade-of-the-united-states-fatus/u-s-agricultural-trade-data-update/#U.S.%20agricultural%20imports,%20year-to-date%20and%20current%20months". The datasets being used are an excel sheet (U.S. agricultural imports, year-to-date and current months), and a zip file of archives from previous years (U.S. agricultural imports, archive).
