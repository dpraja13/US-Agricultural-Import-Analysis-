#### Keywords:

Price Trends, Domestic Consumption Trends, Trade Data Analysis

#### Description:

This project aims to conduct an analysis of state-level agricultural imports and exports using data from the USDA Economic Research Service. The dataset contains detailed information on agricultural imports and exports for different states, including values for various product categories and countries of origin. Key questions to be addressed include:

- How do agricultural import and export patterns vary across different states?
- Which commodities are most commonly imported and exported by different states?
- What trends in import and export values suggest changes in state-level consumption or production patterns?

#### Intellectual Merit:

This project will provide new insights into the regional dynamics of agricultural imports and exports  within the United States. By analyzing state-level data, it can uncover localized trends in import or export preferences and needs, potentially reflecting differences in local agricultural production, consumer tastes, or economic factors. 

#### Data Sourcing:

The primary data source is the USDA Economic Research Service dataset on state-level agricultural imports. The data can be directly retrieved from the following website - https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/state-agricultural-trade-data/. It includes detailed information on imports and exports by state, fiscal year, country, commodity, and dollar value. This granular data allows for in-depth analysis of import patterns at both the state and national levels.
