#### 10/28/2024

#### Keywords:

Price Trends, Domestic Consumption Trends, Trade Data Analysis

#### Description:

This project aims to conduct an analysis of state-level agricultural imports and exports using data from the USDA Economic Research Service. The dataset contains detailed information on agricultural imports and exports for different states, including values for various product categories and countries of origin. 

#### Research Questions:

RO1: To describe the trends within agricultural import and export patterns across different states. 
RO2: To predict the value of agricultural imports and exports for a state based on its trade patterns.
RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2.
RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model.
RO5: To classify states into high, medium, or low agricultural import dependency categories based on their import-export ratios.

#### Intellectual Merit:

This project will provide new insights into the regional dynamics of agricultural imports and exports within the United States. By analyzing state-level data, it can uncover localized trends in import or export preferences and needs, potentially reflecting differences in local agricultural production, consumer tastes, or economic factors. The predictive model will contribute to understanding the interplay between imports, and exports at the state level.

#### Data Sourcing:

The primary data source is the USDA Economic Research Service dataset on state-level agricultural imports and exports. The data can be directly retrieved from the USDA Economic Research Service website (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/state-agricultural-trade-data/). It includes detailed information on imports and exports by state, fiscal year, country, commodity, and dollar value. This granular data allows for in-depth analysis of import and export patterns at state levels.
