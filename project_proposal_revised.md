#### 10/28/2024

#### Keywords:

Price Trends, Domestic Consumption Trends, Trade Data Analysis

#### Description:

This project aims to conduct an analysis of state-level agricultural imports and exports using data from the USDA Economic 
Research Service. The dataset contains detailed information on agricultural imports and exports for different states, including 
values for various product categories, countries of origin, Fiscal Quater, and Year. It also finds trends between trade patterns and seanalities. 

#### Research Questions:

- RO1: To describe the trends within agricultural import and export patterns across different states.
- RO2: To classify states into high, medium, or low agricultural import dependency categories by leveraging their import-export ratios and analyzing seasonal fluctuations to capture the relation between trade patterns and temporal variations.
- RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2.
- RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model.

#### Intellectual Merit:

This project will offer new knowledge on agricultural trade dynamics at the state level within the United States. By analyzing state-specific import and export patterns, it will uncover localized trends and dependencies that reflect distinct regional factors such as production capacity, consumer demand, and economic influences. A new aspect of this research lies in comparing trade data across seasons, which can reveal previously unexamined temporal variations in trade dependencies. Through the development and defense of a predictive model, this research will capture trade patterns and reveal relationships, contributing to the broader understanding of agricultural trade flows. 

#### Data Sourcing:

The primary data source is the USDA Economic Research Service dataset on state-level agricultural imports and exports. The data can be 
directly retrieved from the USDA Economic Research Service website (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/state-agricultural-trade-data/). 
It includes detailed information on imports and exports by state, fiscal year, country, commodity, and dollar value. This granular 
data allows for in-depth analysis of import and export patterns at state levels.
